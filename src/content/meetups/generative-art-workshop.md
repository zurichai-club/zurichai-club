## Workshop mode
We are building a visual pipeline from scratch and live remixing results. Expect fast loops, a lot of prompt hacking, and practical constraints.

## You will learn
- How to build a modular prompt grid.
- How to steer style with LoRAs without killing composition.
- How to batch your experiments and keep only the signal.

## Requirements
- A laptop with a modern browser.
- Optional: any SD or ComfyUI setup you can show.
