## What we are building
A lightweight agent stack that can route, plan, and act across a real workflow. The goal: a repeatable pattern, not a demo.

## Topics
- Tool calling with guardrails.
- Memory that does not drift.
- Automations that do not spam your calendar.

## Bring
A GitHub account and a working email for sandbox access.
